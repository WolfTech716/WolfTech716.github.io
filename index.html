  <h1> Designing a website from HTML code.</h1>
  <h2> I love you so much my love, you are <b>BEAUTIFUL</b>!</h2>
  <h3> The text is now decreasing.</h3>
  <h4> A couple more sizes to go.</h4>
  <h5> I will add some <i>italicized words</i> to this layer.</h5>
  <h6> Finally <u>this is the last text</u> I will type for this example.</h6>
  <p> We are now going to test out a <u>paragraph</u> element.  The paragraph
    element is helpful to have text appear more formatted and proper.</p>
  <p> This is yet another paragraph just to show how it can look when you have
    yet another piece of text.  I will write anothe rsentence after this one to
    make sure that the content is an actual "paragraph", <i>if you catch my drift</i>.
